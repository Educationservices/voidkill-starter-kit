# V01dK1LL

This is the Official explanation for V01dK1LL.
**This is not a tutorial, this is just a explanation.**

V01dK1LL will M√RD3R AND HIDE THE B0D13S OF extensions like Senso, GoGuardian, Lanschool, Secerus, Securly, IBoss, Cisco (unless applied with Network), Net Reef, Bark, InstantAI™ and many more supported extensions, aswell as maintain it forever even after restart.
(Note: Some extensions that have never been on the chrome webstore and have been installed from a source not known will not be removed.)


It will also kill the managed wallpaper, allowing a custom wallpaper to be applied.

This will also kill the process that makes it so you cant use the chromebook at night or early morning. (curfew)

If you try accessing the old extensions with a bookmark, (or have applied the EXPL01T without powerwashing,)
You will see it has been blocked by Chrome.

Oh yeah, this does require powerwashing before you do the expl01t to completely remove the supported extensions and you cant put the wifi in until you do the expl01t.


# Upsides
• Everything i just said.


# Downsides
• This breaks chrome webstore and all google images (like account pictures and etc on chrome, not the images section of your search)

• If you have a managed wallpaper, you could get in trouble if they see your laptop, so i recommend finding the wallpaper/getting the wallpaper before the expl01t so you can apply it again.

• Pretty hard to do the exploit

• Need to be on school wifi to do the exploit

• Need External wifi along with school wifi

Have fun!!!1!1!
