# voidkill-starter-kit
This is the starter pack for Voidkill, a extension killer+wallpaper changer.
**This is not a tutorial, this is just a explanation.**

VoidKill will KILL extensions like Senso, and other supported extensions, aswell as maintain it forever even after restart.
(Note: Some extensions that have never been on the chrome webstore and have been installed from a source not known will not be removed.)

It will also kill the managed wallpaper, allowing a custom wallpaper to be applied.

This will also kill the process that makes it so you cant use the chromebook at night or early morning. (curfew)

If you try accessing the old extensions with a bookmark, (or have applied the EXPL01T without powerwashing,)
You will see it has been blocked by Chrome.

# Downsides
• This breaks chrome webstore and all google images (like account pictures and etc on chrome, not the images section of your search)

• If you have a managed wallpaper, you could get in trouble.

• Pretty hard to do the exploit

• Need to be on school wifi to do the exploit

• Need External wifi along with school wifi
