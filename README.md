# voidkill-starter-kit
This is the starter pack for Voidkill, a extension killer+wallpaper changer.
**This is not a tutorial, this is just a explanation.**

VoidKill will KILL extensions like Senso, and other supported extensions, aswell as maintain it forever even after restart.
It will also kill the managed wallpaper, allowing a custom wallpaper to be applied.
(Note: Some extensions that have never been on the chrome webstore and have been installed from a source not known will not be removed.)
This will also kill the process that makes it so you cant use the chromebook at night or early morning. (curfew)

If you try accessing the old extensions with a bookmark, (or have applied the EXPL01T without powerwashing,)
You will see it has been blocked by Chrome.
